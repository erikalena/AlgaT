## Description

AlgaT is a tutorial application based on JavaFX. It's aim is to explain what greedy programming is through explanations, interactive components and questions. The application is divided is comoposed by an introduction and two main lessons about Prim and Kruskal's algorithms.

## Structure

<ul>
<li>Game: a simple game useful to verify that the user has understood the concepts illustrated. The game takes up a typical example in the literature of greedy algorithms.</li>
<li>Lessons:
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Algorithms
  <ul>
  <li>Kruskal's algorithm: discussion about Kruskal's algorithm, which proceeds by points and involves the user with question and exercices.</li>
  <li>Prim's algorithm: this section deals with providing a brief introduction to Prim's algorithm, which is used to determe the minimum spanning tree for an undirected and connected graph.</li>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul> 

At the end of each section, the user can find questions and exercises.
